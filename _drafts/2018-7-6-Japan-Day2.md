title: Japan, Day 2

Roaming around Tokyo half asleep in our attempts to combat jetlag.

## Experiencing Japan from a firehose

Our first full day from morning to dusk in the heart of Japan.

### The Rail System

As sunshine poked through the curtains in the living room, Chris and I intermittently jumped in and out of conciousness. When I could no longer force myself asleep, I prepped for the day. While we were waiting for the girls to finish prepping, we organized a plan to visit Tokyo proper. 

With a plan set and everyone ready to tackle the day with however few amount of hours of sleep, we set out the door for the well-known punctual Japanese Rail system.
