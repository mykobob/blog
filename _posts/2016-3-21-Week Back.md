# Week 9: 3/21-3/25

## What did I do this week?

This week had a huge focus on the allocator project. However, because my partner and I already had experience in writing a heap, writing code the handle all of the cases was pretty straightforward for us. We had already encountered the bugs we had during this project, so we didn't make the same mistake twice (however, the first time, those bugs were really annoying). The other main thing I did was my CS 105 project. I had to write a random writer (basically one of the CS314H projects). However, this project added some bonus where I had to train on news headlines and make random tweets based on this training data.

## What's in my way?

The allocator project was my main obstacle. However, we finished that pretty quickly. Other than that, I reviewed my exam and looked at the points where I missed. I had missed a lot of points because of small errors.

## What will I do next week?

I will solidfy my understanding of const pointers or pointers to const. I liked how these concepts were presented in a manner as Downing gave us examples of use cases. It was helpful to understand why in the world we would use the keyword const.

## Recent Discovery

In the midst of doing my twitter bot, I came across [Twython](https://github.com/ryanmcgrath/twython) which made features to update my twitter information so much easier.
