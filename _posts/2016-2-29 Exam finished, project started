# Week 7: 2/29-3/4

## What did I do this week?

This week was exam week. The exam I was looking forward to. Most of this week was dedicated to studying for my two midterms. I had a Language and Computing midterm on thursday - the day before the OOP midterm. So, I had to really divvy up my time to make sure I had adequate time to study for both. It was stressful to say the least.

## What's in my way?

This new project is in my way. However, I have done something really similar to this before. I had exposure to understanding how a heap worked under the hood, so I'm hoping that my knowledge there will help me with this project. 

## What will I do next week?

I will meet up with my partner, Greg McDonald, and discuss design with him. I will also understand the skeleton code that he provided for us. Just like the past pair programming assignment, I will strive to ensure that the times we work on the project are together. 

## Recent Discovery

One thing to keep in mind while designing your algorithm for any problem is to keep your sights on the main problem. It can be easy to go on tangents about small details about how to handle certain cases. This will detract from the original problem and will extend the time you need to work on the project.
