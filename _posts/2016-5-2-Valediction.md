# Week 15: 5/2-5/6

## What did I do this week?

I finished up studying and doing OOP. I joined the same study group I had for the first midterm. We exhaustively covered all of the topics on the review guide and even discussed really obscure intricacies of C++. This really helped understanding the reasoning for the different design choices made by the C++ creators. 

## What's in my way?

I have an essay and one more final before I'm free for summer!! :D Gotta make this last week count. 

## What will I do next week?

I will continue to work through my final two assignments. I will finish my essay by Monday and study for my Linguistics final on Friday. 

## Thoughts

This class really covered C++ to deep detail. Sometimes, the design choice would be non-intuitive, but with the plethora of code examples and usage examples, it all made sense. After taking this class, I now have the confidence to use C++ in a bigger scale project as I'll know how to track bugs down in C++. 

## Tip of the Week

As this the last week of OOP, one thing to remember is that though we may forget the material we learned in class, the next time we come back to the topics we learned, it'll be much easier to pick up again. We won't truly forget the material. The lesson here is that we typically learn by iteration, so it's good to review class materials after a while - to keep them fresh in our minds.
