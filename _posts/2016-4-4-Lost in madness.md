# Week 11: 4/4-4/8

## What did I do this week?

This week was mainly focused on Darwin. Just like last week, my partner and I were doubting ourselves to whether or not the code we were writing was allowed by the specs. The main problem we had with our Darwin project was how modularized our code was. Because of this, we had to write many, many unit tests to satify the 3 unit tests per function. In the end, we turned it in in the nick of time. *phew*

## What's in my way?

With this project done and one left, I am currently looking for a partner. I'm going to have to get out of my comfort zone and ask people to be my partner. It's difficult, but in the end, overcoming this awkwardness barrier will be more beneficial than detrimental. 

## What will I do next week?

I will continue to do the readings and review the concepts covered in class - remembering and understanding all the details about C++ that Downing has been teaching us. 

## Recent Discovery

In light of all of the principles we have been reading about, I came across this [article](https://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2016/04/01/why-i-hate-best-practices.aspx?m=1) that talks about not always defaulting to the "best practices." The main idea is that these practices have a good purpose and work in most situations. However, if it's hard to justify the "best practice", then maybe it's time to use something else.
