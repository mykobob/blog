# Week 12: 4/11-4/15

## What did I do this week?

This week was full of planning for Life. Last project, we had a lot of functions, so that meant a lot of testing. All the methods we had were so that we would have that good design. Hopefully, this project my partner and I can have a better/cleaner design without all of those methods. Also this week, we talked about inheritence and abstract classes. Similar to Java's way, but also very different. It is good to know the differences between the two.

## What's in my way?

Nothing really. It's just the Life project.

## What will I do next week?

My partner and I will write more unit tests for our Life project. The main code is pretty much donw, so it's all up to the unit tests.

## Recent Discovery

I read an [article](http://www.wired.com/2016/04/google-ensures-services-almost-never-go/?mbid=social_twitter) talking about how Google can keep a pretty much 100% uptime rate (or high enough that people blame their internet provider first before blaming Google). It's really interesting how software engineers and sysadmins are molding together; leading to Site Reliability Engineers (@ Google).
