# Week 10: 3/28-4/1

## What did I do this week?

This week had a focus on writing a good OO design for the project Darwin. It has been a struggle because the specific semantics behind getters and setters is not very clear. Other than that, the main task today has been trying to flush out a design and program that would abide by the requirments.

## What's in my way?

One main struggle for this project is the avoidance of getters and setters. There would be many instances where my partner and I would not know whether or not a certain function counds as a getter or setter. This greatly slowed our progress because we would be making good progress only to stop because we were sure if a function we wrote was allowed. 

## What will I do next week?

We will finish writing our Darwin world and unit tests. It's a bit more difficult than the projects we had before, so I do expect to be working on this a lot.

## Recent Discovery

We had interesting bugs with accessing private variables even though the code was residing in the parent's class (inner classes). This Stackoverflow [post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11405069/inner-class-accessing-outer-class) helped clear things up.
