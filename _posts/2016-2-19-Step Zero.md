# Week 4: 2/8 - 2/12

## What did I do this week?

This week was cram week. My partner, Rachel Oei, and I worked on Voting extensively. When we made our code very object oriented, we found that we had a lot of methods. This unfortunately meant that the number of unit tests had to increase accordingly (these methods still counted!). So, my partner and I had to add numerous amounts of unit tests to compensate. It was painful, but we got it done. I am proud to say that we worked together most of the time! The only time we didn't work together was for about an hour when we were swamped with our individual homework. 

I like the fact that Downing is allowing us to pair program. I particularly like it because we can bounce ideas off each other and find hidden bugs with each others design. This greatly lowered the number of bugs in our code. Even when some bugs sneaked through, it was easy to find them because Rachel and I had different mindsets and in turn, viewed the code with different assumptions. 

## What's in my way?

The next unannounced project is in my way. I have decided to partner up with Greg McDonald. My schedule with Rachel had little to no problems, and I'm hoping that this continues with Greg. If not, like any good partner, I'll make time to fit other people's schedules

## What will I do next week?

Because no project is due any time soon, I'll begin studying for the Midterm. I don't know that to expect, so I'm basically going to study all the material that was taught/read. I have a feeling that because Downing was so meticulous about the details of C++, the midterm will also reflect that sentiment. 

## Recent Discovery

Be sure to read the comments in all of the files you're given. There were some instructions for Doxygen that my partner and I didn't read and ultimately came back to haunt us. Those instructions were the right instructions to generate the nice html pages for documenation.
