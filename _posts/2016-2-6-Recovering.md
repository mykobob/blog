# Week 2: 2/1 - 2/5

## What did I do this week?

This week was all ups and downs. I started off the week with FoCS dinner night. To be honest, I mainly went for the food. I did talk to one company, but I was frank about me already having an internship lined up for this summer, so it wasn't too awkward. However, after that my week was pretty intense. I thought I was done with Collatz, but because of wrong assumptions, there were a few changes to the project. We had to respect those changes, so I had to change my test case generation program. The entirety of the project was very stressful. As for the class, I still enjoy Downing's approach to teaching us C++. He has a good picture of what we know, so he gives good analogies to help us wrap what new concept C++ brings to the table.

## What's in my way?

Just like last week, my quiz scores were dismal. I didn't do as well as I had hoped from last week. I studied for the quiz as I had planned to last week, but unlucky for me, I forgot that there was a reading we had to do. As a result, I missed most of the the quiz questions that were over the reading. This will be added to my studying for the quizzes. Though the readings have good quiz material, I just really hope the future quizzes will be more focused on the material taught in class. I feel like that would be more useful to know instead of, say, the history of OOP. 

## What will I do next week?

For this next week, I will be finishing up my Collatz project. I am currently running into issues regarding memory usage, so I'll have to come up with a more clever method of caching. In addition, I have been losing track of my issues. I would fix one issue but also fix another issue without committing. Because of this, I am reverting a bit of my code so that each commit will fix a particular issue. So for the rest of this project and the following projects, I am resolved to pay attention to the issues I assigned. This way, each commit will be short and isolated - as what was taught in class. 

## Recent Discovery

For my side project, I found it really useful to plan every subpart of the project on paper. This way, I was able to clearly see how each component interacted with each other. This included writing the database table diagrams (with foreign keys and everything) to drawing what data structures would be tossed in between the front-end and back-ends. This gave me more confidence that my design was sound.
