# Week 3: 2/1 - 2/5

## What did I do this week?

This week was all ups and downs. I started off the week with FoCS dinner night. To be honest, I mainly went for the food. I did talk to one company, but I was frank about me already having an internship lined up for this summer, so it wasn't too awkward. However, after that my week was pretty intense. I thought I was done with Collatz, but because of wrong assumptions, there were a few changes to the project. We had to respect those changes, so I had to change my test case generation program. The entirety of the project was very stressful. As for the class, I still enjoy Downing's approach to teaching us C++. He has a good picture of what we know, so he gives good analogies to help us wrap what new concept C++ brings to the table.

## What's in my way?

Collatz and the changing of the project specs were in my way, but that is over with. In continuation of my struggles with the quizzes, I once again haven't been performing well on them. Though my scores haven't improved, my confidence going into the quizzes have been a lot higher than before. This is mainly because I have been doing my readings. 

## What will I do next week?

For this next week, I will start working on the next project. Communicate with my partner the restrictions, bounds and basically everthing there is to discuss about for the project. The goal here is to have everything planned before actually writing code. This allows us to see any potential flaws in our design before we encounter the bug while coding. 

## Recent Discovery

[Android Annotations](https://github.com/excilys/androidannotations/wiki) are super cool - even to a point where I would say it's pretty much hacking. Basically, in Android Development, there is a lot of code that has very similar structure for basically all views. Annotations noticies this and simplifies that process by just having an annotation to denote that bulky piece of code.
