# Week 14: 4/25-4/29

## What did I do this week?

This week was mainly focused on studying for the final. I've come a long way learning C++ and OO design in this class. This week was really designated in reviewing all the material we learned - up until the last detail. We also stopped doing quizzes, so this means that I can no longer seek to replace my low quiz grades. 

## What's in my way?

Naturally, my finals and final assignments are the main road blockers in my way.

## What will I do next week?

I will continue reviewing all of the classes Downing wrote throughout the 2nd half of the semester. This will include reading the classes and undestanding the underlying reasons for why this implementation was done the way it was. 

## Thoughts

We continued working on the handle class and making improvements to it. It's good that we heavily talk about this because when I review the classes, I'll always wonder why this certain implementation was done instead of another way. It also gives me peace of mind when I understand a certain design choice. 

## Tip of the Week

I read an [article](http://www.wired.com/2016/04/openai-elon-musk-sam-altman-plan-to-set-artificial-intelligence-free/) that talks about how AI is really making a breakthrough and allowing AI people to develop AI without the pressure of needing to monetize the AI technology. Really interesting stuff.
