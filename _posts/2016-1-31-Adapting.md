# Week 2: 1/25 - 1/29

## What did I do this week?

We continued discussion about Collatz. How do we make our naive solution even faster? What are the key insights for making our solution faster? We discussed these methods and settled upon caching results that we have computed. I liked how Professor Downing discussed/led us in a discussion that involved us to figure out this optimization. Once this idea of caching was established and because the idea of caching is very broad, we delved into the different types of caching, such as eager, lazy, and meta caching. The first two were very intuitive to me, but when we talked about meta caching, I was taken aback. The thought of precomputing values and pasting them in my program was surprising to me. But as we discussed in detail what this entails and how we have to conform with the restrictions, the discussion we had increased. We were soon discussing different workarounds for the memory constraints. 

## What's in my way?

Just like last week, my quiz scores were dismal. I didn't do as well as I had hoped from last week. I studied for the quiz as I had planned to last week, but unlucky for me, I forgot that there was a reading we had to do. As a result, I missed most of the the quiz questions that were over the reading. This will be added to my studying for the quizzes. Though it is good to quiz on the material, I just really hope the future quizzes will be more focused on the material taught in class. I feel like that would be more useful to know instead of the history of OOP. 

## What will I do next week?

For this next week, I will be finishing up my Collatz project. I am currently running into issues regarding memory usage, so I'll have to come up with a more clever method of caching. In addition, I have been losing track of my issues. I would fix one issue but also fix another issue without committing. Because of this, I am reverting a bit of my code so that each commit will fix a particular issue. So for the rest of this project and the following projects, I am resolved to pay attention to the issues I assigned. This way, each commit will be short and isolated - as what was taught in class.
