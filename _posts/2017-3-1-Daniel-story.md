title: The Story of Daniel 1-6
---

I had thought I posted this a while ago. Nonetheless, here is a review of 2/24-2/25 retreat's main passage.

## Background

According to historical records, this account is predicted to have been written 2300 years ago, and it documents the adventures Daniel and his friends went through as they were serving God. 

## Story

This story starts off with King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon invading both Jerusalem and Judah. He brings all of the young men back into the kingdom of Babylon so that these young men can be enticed by the luxuries Babylon has to offer. The goal of this was to not only throw shade at the other kingdoms but also have them lose sight of what their identity was. Back then, their faith and their name was a key component to their identity. Because they are far removed from their community, it is easy for them to lose sight of what's right and what's not. This worked for most of the men they grabbed, but it did not affect Daniel and his friends - Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. Though they had Babylonian names, they were still strong in their faith.

One day, King Nebuchadnezzar had a dream that was very mysterious. Of the people who Nebuchadnezzar called, no one knew what the dream was saying. Eventually, somehow, Daniel was called up. According to Daniel, this dream was a hint that Nebuchadnezzar's kingdom will soon fall if he doesn't do anything drastic for the Israelites soon. Despite knowing God's character, Nebuchadnezzar recognizes God's influence and threat but doesn't act to avoid his kingdon's downfall. This is evident when he decides to punish Daniel and his friends when they don't fall down and worship him as king. Nebuchadnezzar punishes them by sending them into the flames of a mighty furnace. However, when he finds that none of them are affected, he again acknowledges God as God, but doesn't change any of his actions. 

Throughout these situations where Nebuchadnezzar and the following kings of Babylon, these people repeatedly see the wonders that God does through and for Daniel but never really acknowledge this fact. 

## Steps of Faith

I really admired the steps of faith Daniel and his friends had to take in order to be able to do the things they did. It's important to note the different acts of defiance they did to maintain their allegiance towards God.

1. When he decided not to eat the king's food. 
  * This sounds very tiny, and it is relatively tiny. All Daniel was risking is his relationship with the Eunuch. However, he chose to do this so that he would not compromise of the different convictions he had from before.
2. Didn't bow down to King Nebuchadnezzar.
  * This sounds obvious, but with the punishment that Nebuchadnezzar in mind, it's mind boggling how they would still lay down their lives to stay true to God. 
  * "But even if he does not, we want you to know, Your Majesty, that we will not serve your gods or worship the image of gold you have set up." (Daniel 3:18 NIV)
