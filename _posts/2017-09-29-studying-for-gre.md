Thoughts on how my studying of the GRE is different than my studying of the SAT

## Main Differences 

I've never been an avid reader. Unless the topic was science fiction, greek mythology, or required reading, I would not read anything. This and the SAT prep crash course that I took heavily affected my approach towards the reading comprehension section on the SAT. 

### Previous Approach

Before, I would approach the reading comprehension by first reading the questions and attempt to find the answer in the paragraph that I needed to read. I did really poorly on the reading comprehension section of the SAT. However looking back, it's ironic that I had called that approach "reading comprehension". There was no comprehension at all in that approach. I was more looking rather than comprehending the material.

### New approach

Going through college, I learned _how to read_. What? 

Now, this is what I mean. The point of a college education is to learn the material presented in class and not memorize it so that I can regurgitate it on the exam. With this goal in mind, this meant that I need to read the textbooks/papers to comprehend what the high level main idea is. _How to read_ implies understanding the material at hand so that when I encounter a situation where I need to explain the material in my own words, I can properly rephrase what I learned without messing with the core ideas.  

This is how I should have been approaching the reading comprehension section in the SAT, and this is how I will be approaching the GRE reading comprehension section.
